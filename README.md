# Lahmsche-Orgel
A little Supercolider Synthesizer with multi paradigmen Synthese Created after study musical Acoustic

Reday-To-Use:
The Lahmsche-Overton-Synthesizer.

This little Program have I build after my Study of Acoustic by my self and with the Help on the Universit√§ts-Bibliothek-Essen. In this Study I have read many about so called stationary and no-stationary Sounds. And about the Construction of Sound by the Category of so called Formants. So I decided to build a Synth with this two points in respect.
My Program work with a Impulse-Generator. A Impulse-Generator has the ability of a wonderful Overtone Spectrum. So he is used by many of the Great Electro-Akustik Composers, like Stockhausen. The Signal after build goes through a Formant-Filter. A Formant-Filter is a set of Bandpassfilters which work parallel. The Corner Frequency's ( The highest and lowest Frequency who travel through each Filter ). Is not stationary. It will modulate by a distortion signal. This signal could modulate from the player of the synth. Also the Gain of each Filter could be modulated. The Problem that will arise is a too much of Distortion. So I have integrated a Pitch-Finder Filter. This Filter is used to explore is there a clear melodic Component in the End-Signal. Is there not the Signal will be truncated. A second Filter for over Gain has been tested, but would not good working.
So the last step was to Play the Synth. I chose that for a first test it would be great to play fifths and fourths Intervals of a Melody.
I hope you will inspired by this little Synth, and build your own, or play any other Melody or Rhythm with it.
